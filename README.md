### Model Evaluation and Comparison System
## Overview
The Model Evaluation and Comparison System is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the process of evaluating and comparing different machine learning models. The system supports multiple model types and provides detailed metrics to facilitate informed decision-making. It includes a Postman collection for easy API testing and interaction.

## Features
Model Evaluation: Evaluate multiple machine learning models using a standardized set of metrics.
Comparison: Compare the performance of different models side-by-side.
Metrics: Detailed metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and more.
Postman Collection: Pre-configured Postman collection for testing and interacting with the API endpoints.

## Requirements
Python 3.7+
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/prth1234/Model-Evaluation-and-Comparision-System.git
cd Model-Evaluation-and-Comparision-System
2. Create a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///models.db
5. Initialize the Database
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
6. Running the Application
flask run

The application will start running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

API Endpoints
1. Upload Model
Endpoint: /api/models/upload
Method: POST
Description: Upload a machine learning model for evaluation.
Body Parameters:

model_file (file): The model file to be uploaded.
2. Evaluate Model
Endpoint: /api/models/evaluate
Method: POST
Description: Evaluate a uploaded model on a specified dataset.
Body Parameters:

model_id (string): The ID of the model to be evaluated.
dataset_file (file): The dataset file for evaluation.
3. Compare Models
Endpoint: /api/models/compare
Method: POST
Description: Compare multiple models and return detailed metrics.
Body Parameters:

model_ids (list): List of model IDs to be compared.
Postman Collection
A Postman collection is included in the repository for easy testing and interaction with the API. To use the collection:

Open Postman.
Import the Model_Evaluation_and_Comparison_System.postman_collection.json file from the project root.
Use the pre-configured requests to interact with the API.
